[Notify](https://github.com/sir-dunxalot/notify/blob/master/notify.js) is a small notification library (1.8kb) that easily integrates with any Ember-CLI app to queue and display notifications (a.k.a. flash messages) to the user.

Example use cases include showing the user a server error or showing a success message after saving some data.

Installation via command line is simple:

```
npm install em-notify --save-dev
```

Usage is simple too. In any route, controller, or view:

```js
// this.notify(<type>, <message>, [<duration>]);
this.notify('warning', 'Uh oh, you have no money left in your account');
```

This method is made available everywhere in your app (routes, views, inline scripts, etc). To display the notifications to the user, place a handlebars helper anywhere in your application or route-specific templates:

```handlebars
{{em-notify}}
```

Notifications persist through route transitions and, therefore, you do not have to place `{{em-notify}}` in the application template - it will function correctly in route-specific templates too.

By default, notifications will be shown for 3 seconds before the next notification is made visible. Only one notification will be shown at a time. However, you can change the default as follows:

```
{{em-notify interval=1000}} // Milliseconds
```

You can also override the duration for individual messages:

```js
// this.notify(<type>, <message>, [<duration>]);
this.notify('warning', 'Uh oh, you have no money left in your account', 1000);
```
