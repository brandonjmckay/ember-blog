Summer is nearly upon us so we've put together a list of five summer jams our team has been listening to, to get in the mood for the better weather.

<!-- Hold on, we're going home-->

A lot of Drake's songs are great for getting pumped up during a long coding session (e.g. 'Trophies', 'Started From the Bottom', 'Pop That') but the full sounding instrumental accompaniment in 'Hold on, We're Going Home' enriches Drake's uncommon melodic vocals:

<!-- Talk is Cheap-->

Chet Faker's 'Talk is Cheap' has a similar vibe but moves along more effortlessly, placefully settling any coder into a harmonious sense of focus.

<!-- The Hunter-->

On and On were featured at SXSW in 2013 - the year before Jebbit was named "Top Startup at SXSW".

<!-- Help me loose my mind-->

Disclosure received a nomination at this year's Grammy Awards. The electronica sound of 'Help me Loose my Mind' is one of fifteen tracks from the album nominated for Best Dance/Electronica.

<!-- Jubel-->

Our {{#link-to 'post' 'the-leak-attack-part-1'}}very first leak attack{{/link-to}} featured Klingande's track 'Punga' but 'Jubel', the only other track on the album, meshes the sounds of 'Punga' with the seblance of a summer spent in the South of France
