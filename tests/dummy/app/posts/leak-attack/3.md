The Jebbit Summer Bash, The Jebalina Wine Mixer, 3ohfunfest 2014, and the Month of Funtober all have one thing in common: Friday Night Shenanigans. I am, of course, referring to the infamous 'networking' events hosted by Jebbit Tech.

Here are five of our favorite songs played at the last few events:

<!-- Dancing in My Head -->

Avicii made two remixes of Eric Turner's 2012 song 'Dancing in my Head' - one under his stage name of Avicii and one under the alias of Tom Hangs. Here's the latter:

<!-- Jealous (I ain't With it) - Chromeo -->

Canadian duo Chromeo describe themselves as "the only successful Arab/Jewish partnership since the dawn of human culture." Whilst they've never placed in the US charts 'Jealous (I ain't with it)' was their first single to debut in the Canadian charts, at no. 12:

<!-- Come and get It -->

Jump Smoker's remix of 'Come and Get it' was a go-to song during the 2013 football season at BC, where our team has a tailgate spot. It still frequents our party playlists from time to time:

<!-- Dance wiv me -->

Dizzee Rascal never achieved widespread fame in the US, but the London-based rapper's song 'Dance Wiv Me' went platinum in Europe in 2008. The song was brought to us by a British teammate:

<!-- Dear boy -->

Another Avicii track, 'Dear Boy', is not the most well-known song on the massively successful album 'True', but it's a great mix to turn the party up a notch with his classic full-toned EDM sound:
